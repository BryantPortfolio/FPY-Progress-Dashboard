# FPY-Progress-Dashboard
Power BI dashboard demonstrating First Pass Yield (FPY), UNSAT analysis,and dynamic date intelligence using synthetic data.

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project demonstrates a production style quality analytics dashboard designed to track First Pass Yield (FPY), SAT/UNSAT trends, and root cause patterns across internal shops and external third party contractors. 

The dashboard dynamically adapts to: 
  - Weekly, Monthly, and yearly views using calendar filtering, interactive buttons for 'Current Week' and "Last 12 months'
  - Single or multiple shop selections
  - Rolling 12-month analysis windows

ALL DATA SHOWN IS SYNTHETIC AND USED SOLEY FOR PORTFOLIO DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES. 

BUSINESS PROBLEM 

Quality and Production teams often struggle to: 
  - Identify declining FPY early
  - Understand which UNSAT reasons drive failures
  - Communicate weekly, monthly, and yearly performance trends clearly

The dashboard addresses those challenges by providing clear KPIs per shop or RA, drill downs, and context-aware labeling.
